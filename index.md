        Docker Enterprise is the easiest and fastest way to use containers and [Kubernetes](https://www.docker.com/products/kubernetes) at scale and delivers the fastest time to production for modern applications, securely running them from hybrid cloud to the edge.

        Over 750 enterprise organizations use Docker Enterprise for everything from modernizing traditional applications to [microservices](https://www.docker.com/solutions/microservices)and data science.

**Lorem Ipsum** is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
